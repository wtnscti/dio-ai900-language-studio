inputsAfter such a great weekend I am bummed to have to leave a 1 star review. After getting home from our stay I realized I had left a brand new pair of water shoes behind in the room. (I had purchased them specifically for this trip.) I called the front desk and the gentleman that answered said he would do some checking and call me back. He called me back about 5 minutes later and said nobody knew anything about them. So either you don’t clean between visitors or you have staff that is stealing. 
It saddens me that such a nice place has staff that can’t be trusted. 
Secondly, we dined at the restaurant and while the food was ok, the wait staff was not. We didn’t get the complimentary bread, she seemed rather put out to even have to wait on us. Later when we were returning to our room from a soak in the hot tub, we heard two of the wait staff talking (very loudly and passionately) about another co worker and using many profanities. Seems like there was a VIP table that had also not been treated with high honors. 
The hotel is great, the landscaping is beautiful, but it seems like there are issues with the staff.
